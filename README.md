## My process

### Built with

- React
- Tailwind
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my very first project using Tailwind. Even though I had to constantly look through the documentation to figure out how to do certain things, the process still felt faster and more efficient than Vanilla CSS. I'm looking forward to using Tailwind again in the future and getting more comfortable with it.
